## Hi there 👋

**Kennel Linux** (KL) — This Linux distribution family, which are discussed on the [Puppy Linux Discussion Forum](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewforum.php?f=228).
They are usually built using the **FIRSTRIB** assembly system - a collection of shell scripts that creates a root file system for downloading with a certain bootloader (for example, GRUB).
Kennel Linux contains a desktop environment, utility and an application of a developer that implements a script.
 
There are many KL distros, each with their own unique features:

- **KLV :** Any KL distro based on [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/). Probably the most popular of these is [KLV-Airedale](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewforum.php?f=191), created by _**<span color='#ff0004'>@rockedge</span>**_
- **KLA :** Any KL distro based on Arch Linux.
- **KLU :** Any KL distro based on Ubuntu. Currently, the only KLU is [KLU-jam-XFCEbase](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=7866), created by _**@wiak**_
- **KL minis :** KL distros that are made to be "**very small**".
- [Kennel Linux distros](https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewforum.php?f=231)
